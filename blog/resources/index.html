        <p>This is the archived version of an old project of mine where I wanted to try optimizing my workflow while programming from my phone. At the time, I had been thinking that it would be neat to not have a laptop, since they have weight and I didn't feel like carrying one around for school. That idea did not last, but I did end up gathering a few resources for programming.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>I think I'll continue this project as a list of resources I find helpful for a variety of projects, so it might the occasional update every once in a while.</p>
