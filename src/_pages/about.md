### Hobbies & Interests

I really enjoy reading Sci-Fi and Fantasy, and I also tell myself I like writing it too. There's a couple of short stories I've gotten published, but I haven't really had time to sit down and write anything lately. I also like camping and hiking and listening to music. (Mostly instrumentals and Christian stuff) There's something about the outdoors that's just begging to be explored.

I also enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and Python, but my knowledge in those three are still fairly basic. I also have a little experience with JavaScript, Kotlin, Tailwind, and HTMX.

You can learn more about what I'm up to on my [now](/now/) page or clicking on **Now** at the top of the page.

### Favorites

Currently my favorite song is World on Fire by for KING & COUNTRY. (Though it's generally their song titled *Wholehearted*)
