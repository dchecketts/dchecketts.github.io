## What's up Doc?

While researching Eleventy, I came across [simpixelated.com](simpixelated.com "A really nicely made personal blog site by Jordan Kohl"), which included a Now page. I thought that was a novel idea, so I decided to do that here too.

### Learning

- Teaching myself HTMX and Tailwind.
- Using online resources to learn more Python outside of a class.
- Currently a freshman in college, majoring in web design and development.

### Projects

- Current project: improving Eleventy build structure and site layout.
- On the back burner: Building a tool to keep track of things for D&D as a Dungeon Master.

### Goals

- Short-term goal: add small interactive modules with HTMX to my site and get a few posts up.
- Learn more about back-end development and look into platforms such as Netlify and Railway to better use HTMX features.

### Personal

- Reading: Working my way through a couple of things.
  - *Hypermedia Systems* by Carson Gross, Adam Stepinski, and Deniz Akşimşek. Good book on HTMX.
  - *Project Hail Mary* by Andy Weir. Pretty excited for [the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m08TxIsFTRI "Youtube trailer for Project Hail Mary").
- Watching: Currently on a **Star Wars: The Clone Wars** Binge. Just restarted the series to introduce my girlfriend to them.
- Playing: Dishonored. I'm pretty close to the end of the game.
