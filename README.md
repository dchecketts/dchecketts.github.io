I built this using a template that I made. WHile this serves as a personal site, it will also serve as a means of testing that template.

## Basic Commands

- `npm run dev`: Type this command into the terminal to see changes live while working in your development environment.
- `npm run dev-tailwind`: Same as above, but to be used if you are using TailwindCSS.
- `npm run tidy`: Standardize file formatting throughout the project to minimize merge conflicts.
- `npm run build`: Used to build the site into what would be served via your chosen web-hosting service.

## File Organization

- You can make your own CSS files to reference in src/styles.
- You can store scripts in src/scripts.
- Except for the homepage, each page is a folder. Main page folders such as about and faq are in src. Within each folder is a index.html to create a clean URL. (example.com/about.html -> example.com/about/)
